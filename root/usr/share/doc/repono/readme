Repono is an app that syncs your online Google Drive with a folder on your computer.

Repono lets you sync any folder with your Google Drive, it could be a folder under your home directory, or on your desktop, or a whole partition. Best yet, it it can be named anything you like (unlike some other Google Drive clients). 
What it does is it simply puts a icon in your panel, clicking on it gives you basic controls over Repono. Such as, Syncing now, opening the local folder, opening the online folder, and opening the settings dialog.


Usage:
Usage is simple.
1.) MAKE SURE YOU HAVE GRIVE INSTALLED!
If not go here: http://www.lbreda.com/grive/download and install the deb package that is right for you, or if you are capable, install from source.

2.) Type (without quotes): "repono" into the terminal. This causes Repono to start and run in background.

3.) <Optional> Add Repono to your startup applications (it is just better that way).

4.) enjoy!
